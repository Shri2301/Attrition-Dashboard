# Company-Attrition - Employee Attrition Dashboard 

This personal project showcases my ability to transform raw HR data into meaningful, interactive visual insights using Power BI. I developed an Employee Attrition Dashboard to analyze and present employee turnover trends across multiple dimensions such as age, department, salary, and gender.

**Note:** The data used in this project is mock data and was created solely for the purpose of this project
